SyntaxTree
##########

  Partial publication

This module is used in a current framework project and is here excerpted pre-released. (`SyntaxTree WIKI`_)

A derivative of this object for creating an abstract syntax tree, is used as a highlighter in the display component of the main project.

The main project is a Python library for creating text-based user interfaces in the terminal emulator, among other things using the ANSI escape sequences as in the VT100.

This will be made available in a separate repository after further testing, bug fixing and full documentation.
